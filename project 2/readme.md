In Project 2, We were given an automobile dataset.

Handling Missing Data:
Data cleaning was the first step to be done, as some of the entries were missing ('?') and needed to be compensated
1). Either by replacing them with values from the remaining, present parameters.
2). Dropping the entire feature after realizing that it would not have made a singificant difference nonetheless.

Missing data that was Continous/Integers were replaced by the mean of the given values.
Categorical data was replaced by the most frequent data/ mode of the given data.

A Machine Learning model was to be fit over the given dataset
