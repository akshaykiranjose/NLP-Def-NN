project-1, needless to say contains the code for project-1 and in that, the file "problem_3&4" has the source code that takes the incomplete image given as part of the project and solves the sparse oprtimization problem using scipy.optimize and finds the sparse matrix.
Proceeds with finding the matrix that can be used to get back the original, or an attempt at getting that via inverse Fourier transformation.

RBG channel images are made out of a 100 x 100 pixel image for the purpose of reconstruction soon after, via the algorithm made earlier.
The content made can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1sETCN0vasFGGWXO63an9JtbTjfZRZzgF)

The file named Problem 5, takes the rgb channel data made earlier and reconstructs a color image from it.
